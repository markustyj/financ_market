VAR - variance and value at risk
stress test

Beta measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to the returns of the overall market.
A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market.
A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security is more volatile than the market.
A negative beta indicates an inverse relationship with the market.

Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks (whose variance is finite) are approximately normally distributed.
