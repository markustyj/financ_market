VAR - variance and value at risk
stress test

<b>Beta</b> measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to the returns of the overall market.
A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market.
A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security is more volatile than the market.
A negative beta indicates an inverse relationship with the market.

Central limit theory: Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks (whose variance is finite) are approximately normally distributed.

Cauchy Distribution
"Fat tail" in the context of the stock market refers to the phenomenon where extreme events (large gains or losses) occur more frequently than predicted by a normal distribution.

1 Key Components of <b>Prospect Theory</b>:

Value Function:Loss Aversion: Losses loom larger than gains. This means that the pain of losing is psychologically more impactful than the pleasure of an equivalent gain.
Diminishing Sensitivity: The value function is concave for gains and convex for losses, reflecting diminishing sensitivity. This means that the difference in value between $100 and $200 feels greater than the difference between $1,100 and $1,200.

Probability Weighting Function:
Overweighting Small Probabilities: People tend to overestimate the likelihood of rare events.
Underweighting Large Probabilities: Conversely, people tend to underestimate the likelihood of more certain events.

6 <mark>anchoring</mark> (anchoring refers to a cognitive bias where individuals rely too heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions, 

7 Price Anchoring: An investor may become anchored to a stock's past high price and refuse to sell it at a current lower price, waiting for it to return to its former level, which might never happen.), 

8 <mark>representativenes heuristics</mark> (Stock Performance: Investors may judge a company's future stock performance based on its recent performance, assuming that short-term trends will continue indefinitely, even if this is not supported by fundamental analysis. Company Stereotypes: An investor might believe that a well-known tech company will always perform well because it has in the past, disregarding potential risks or changes in the market.)

9 Magical thinking in the financial market refers to irrational beliefs or cognitive biases where investors make decisions based on superstition, emotion, or illogical reasoning rather than on sound financial principles and empirical data. This type of thinking can lead to poor investment choices and significant financial losses.
