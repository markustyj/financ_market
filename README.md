VAR - variance and value at risk
stress test

Beta measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to the returns of the overall market.
A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market.
A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security is more volatile than the market.
A negative beta indicates an inverse relationship with the market.

Central limit theory: Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks (whose variance is finite) are approximately normally distributed.

Cauchy Distribution
"Fat tail" in the context of the stock market refers to the phenomenon where extreme events (large gains or losses) occur more frequently than predicted by a normal distribution.
