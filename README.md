VAR - variance and value at risk
stress test

Beta measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to the returns of the overall market.
A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market.
A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security is more volatile than the market.
A negative beta indicates an inverse relationship with the market.

Central limit theory: Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks (whose variance is finite) are approximately normally distributed.

Cauchy Distribution
"Fat tail" in the context of the stock market refers to the phenomenon where extreme events (large gains or losses) occur more frequently than predicted by a normal distribution.

Key Components of Prospect Theory:
Value Function:

Reference Point: People evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point (often the status quo) rather than in absolute terms.
Loss Aversion: Losses loom larger than gains. This means that the pain of losing is psychologically more impactful than the pleasure of an equivalent gain.
Diminishing Sensitivity: The value function is concave for gains and convex for losses, reflecting diminishing sensitivity. This means that the difference in value between $100 and $200 feels greater than the difference between $1,100 and $1,200.
Probability Weighting Function:

Overweighting Small Probabilities: People tend to overestimate the likelihood of rare events.
Underweighting Large Probabilities: Conversely, people tend to underestimate the likelihood of more certain events.
